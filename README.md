# WhatsThatApp
Mobile applications development unit assignment.

A WhatsApp clone built using the React Native framework.

The codebase follows the AirBnB ESLint style guide with a few adjustments seen in the rules section of the .eslintrc.js file.

## How to install and run

**Note**: The repository does not currently include the server code for handling local API requests. As such, much of the application will not operate as designed. The backend portion will be added later and the guide will be amended to reflect that.

Navigate to your preferred directory and run:

`git clone https://github.com/aalumar/WhatsThatApp.git`

If the current version of the repository does not include the node_modules folder, then navigate into WhatsThatApp and run:

`npm install`

The application is built with the help of Expo, therefore, after installing all dependancies, run the following to test on a browser:

`npm run web`

After the application is running in the browser, remember to use your browser's developer tools to toggle the size and use a mobile phone (the application is tested on Pixel 3 and Pixel 5 phones).

Don't hesistate to reach out :)
